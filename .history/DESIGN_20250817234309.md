# üèï UMA Campground ‚Äì UX Case Study  

## 1. Project Overview  
UMA Campground is a modern campground with built-in booking and information site built with Astro.

 The goal was to design and build a **clear, trustworthy, modern and enjoyable booking experience** that is responsive across all devices (mobile and desktop).

- **My Role**: UX/UI Designer & Front-End Developer  
- **Tools**: Figma, Astro, React, Partytown  
- **Deliverables**: Wireframes, Visual Design, Interactive Prototype, Live Implementation

## 2. Research & Discovery  
I love camping every summer and noticed that most of the independent campgrounds look outdated and doesn't really have an online booking system. The layout is a mess and it's hard to navigate and look for the booking portion only to find out that I have to call them to book the site. That's the reason why I decided to design and build this site. 

In addition to my own research of independent campgrounds, I used chatGPT agent mode to conduct competitor analysis (to have a more in-depth result). I wanted to understand **what users expect** and where common pain points existed (not just my own). 

- **What worked**: 
  1. Integrated Booking system
  2. Prominent CTA buttons
  3. Transparent rates/policies
  4. Visual Aids - maps/individual campsite photos
  5. Mobile Responsiveness
  6. Contact Options for Exceptions 
- **What didn‚Äôt**: 
  1. Manual forms/no booking system
  2. No CTAs or hidden CTAs
  3. Lengthy forms
  4. No photos/maps 
**Key Insight**: 
1. Action Oriented CTAs (BOOK NOW - widely used)  
2. Real-time availability and secure payment
3. Step by step form (not overwhelming) - ask what is needed 
4. Transparent rates
5. Visual Storytelling
6. Mobile Optimization

## 3. Wireframing  
To shape the user journey, I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. This let me test layout ideas quickly before committing to visuals.  

### Initial Designs:
- **Homepage**: welcoming hero banner + CTA + quick access to amenities/thingsToDo/rules+rates 
- **Booking Flow**: Users start by selecting a site, confirming guidelines and policy, going over the order summary, checkout and having the confirmation
